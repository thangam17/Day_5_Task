1.JSON iterate overall for loops (for, for in, for of, forEach)

var json = [ { "id": "thangam",
"msg": "hello everyone",
"task": "daily task",
"mail": "parvathythangam1402@gmail.com", },
{ "id": "gold" "msg": "Welcome to all", "task": "day 3 task", "mail": "parvathythangam1402@gmail.com", } ]; //for loop for(var i = 0; i < json.length; i++) { var obj = json[i];

console.log(obj.id);
console.log(obj.msg);
console.log(obj.task);
console.log(obj.mail);
}

//for Each json.forEach(function(obj) { console.log(obj.msg)};

//for In for (var key in json) { if (json.hasOwnProperty(key)) { console.log(json[key].id); //console.log(json[key].msg); } }

//for Of let text = ""; for (let x of json[key].id) { text += x; } console.log(text);

3.Difference between window, screen and document in Javascript

Window

Each browser tab has its own top-level window object. Each element has its own window object too.
nested within a parent window. each of these windows gets its own separate global object.
window always refers to window, but window parent and window top might refer to enclosing windows, giving acess to other execution contexts.
Screen

The window object also has a screen object with properties describing the physical display.
Screen properties width and height are the full screen
screen properties availwidth and availheigth omit the toolbar.
Document

Each window object has a document object to be rendered. These objects get confused in part because HTML elements are addded
to the global object when assigned a unique id.
